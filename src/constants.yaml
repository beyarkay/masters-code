# TODO These sensor bounds are required because it's possible for a sensor to
# spike >10_000 or plummet < -1000 due to hardware instability. However, the
# bounds $[300, 900]$ are too tight and cause lots of clipping that probably
# isn't an issue, but still results in lost information. Ideally these would be
# expanded (I have a hunch $[0, 1024]$ would be adequate), but this would cause
# backwards compatability issues. So these bounds will remain.
